# ch 2 notes

- scaler: a real number

- tensor-1: a vector or 1-dimensional array
- tensor-2: a tensor whose elements are all tensor-1
  (tensor (tensor 1 2) (tensor 3 4))


- RANK: the number of left square brackets before its leftmost scaler
  ex: [[1, 2]] => 2

- Non-empty lists have members and non-scaler tensors have elements.

- All elements of a tensor must have the same shape.

- avoid body recursive functions, if possible; use accumulators
